# Module-10-Building-Your_own_r-Package
For this assignment, we were asked to read over the assigned texts and then build up a DESCRIPTION file for a fictional R Package with the name "Friedman". In this case, since I needed something from the description and I wished to work out what I was reading, I borrowed from the reading by Hiliary Parker and attempted to write a basic TRUE/FALSE package and use that for the title and description. Notably, using Roxygen2 and devtools as recomended resulted in a description lacking some fields listed in the example and with a few that hadn't been mentioned; Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan's book was helpful in parsing these additional spaces out, and leading me to conclude that I did not need to edit them. As I primarily use Rstudio to edit R code I considered listing the Rstudio verison for the depends but ultimately decided that this was a bad idea and just went with the version of R that I had installed. The DESCRIPTION itself was relatively easy to write since I could just fill out a form, though I tired to utlize the methods laid out by Parker in order to weave the DESCRIPTION of the package into the code only to find that I could not quite get the hang of such things. I obviously will have to improve my abilites in the coming weeks.
